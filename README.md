# Troubleshoot Like a Boss

![Like a Boss](assets/likeaboss.jpg)

Nobody's code is perfect, and all browsers don't run that code the exact same way. A developer can be staring at the weirdest issue ever with no clue where to begin troubleshooting. Sometimes, searching Stack Overflow for related issues can feel like an exercise in futility. A developer's mettle can be tested when this happens, so having the right tools and the proper mindset can mean the difference between a five minute fix, and an all-nighter. This repo will serve as a great place for storing tips for troubleshooting, list some great tools, as well as be reference point for new devs who are trying to level up their trouble shooting skill.  Please feel free to submit a PR for any extra tools or tips you think should be added to the list.
